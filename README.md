# Supply Chain Transparency Analysis

My research in graduate school focused on quantifying social transparency in global apparel supply chains. Building on previous research, 
I constructed a framework that defines social supply chain transparency as the degree of external and internal disclosure, 
which can be evaluated in both cases via three aspects: traceability, social sustainability, and purchasing practices.

Because external transparency refers to the degree of disclosure to general public, I realized that I could populate this data by 
collecting mass public information on different companies, and that I could perform a robust analysis of external transparency and possibly gather useful insights.

The goal of such analysis was primarily to extract external transparency scores, formulate hypotheses on what might affect such scores, 
and draw conclusions on two “underlying influences:” political and legal complexity as well as supply chain communication. The analysis
presented here is a statistical augmentation of some of the qualitative and legal research I had to conduct for my research.

The dataset contains the following basic information:

1) Company name
2) Annual Revenue
3) Number of employees
4) Nationality
5) Whether the brand, according to its statement, is sustainability-oriented, trend-oriented, or neutral.

I then also collected information on the following:

1) Does the company publish the name of its suppliers?
2) Does the company publish its Code of Conduct?
3) Does the company publish its audits?
4) Does the company publish a full-cost breakdown of its products?
5) Does the company publish its purchasing practices?

For each criterion, the brand was awarded one point, and the following was extracted as well:

1) Overall score (from 0 - 5)
2) Transparency Rank (Low for 0 and 1, Medium for 2 and 3, and High for 4 and 5)

This analysis explores whether there are any interesting connections between all these variables, such as: which business orientations 
are more transparent, and whether there is any clear distinction between these features across size and revenue.
